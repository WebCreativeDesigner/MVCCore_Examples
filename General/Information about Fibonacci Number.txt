N is a Fibonacci number if and only if 5 N2 + 4 or 5 N2 – 4 is a square number.

For instance,
3 is a Fibonacci number since 5x3(2)+4 is 49 which is 72.....3(2) means 3*3
5 is a Fibonacci number since 5x52–4 is 121 which is 112.....5(2) means 5*5
4 is not a Fibonacci number since neither 5x42+4=84 nor 5x42–4=76 are pefect squares...........4(2) means 4*4

It is easy to test if a whole number is square on a calculator by taking its square root and checking that it has nothing after the decimal point.
